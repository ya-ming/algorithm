## Search

* Linear Search - O(n)
  * Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array
  * Recursive function to do substring search
* Binary Search - O(Logn)
  * Less comparison
  * Find number of occurrences of input `k`
  * Find minimum element in the sorted array which is rotated at an unknown position
  * Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)
* Jump Search - O(âˆšn)
* Exponential Search - O(Logn)
* Ternary Search - O((2 / Log23) * Log2n)
* List Search - O(m*n)
* Fibonacci Search - O(Logn)

### Challenges

* Find the missing number
* Median of two sorted arrays
* Two elements whose sum is closest to zero
* Find the smallest and second smallest elements in an array
* Middle of Three
